## Welcome to the Brain Dump

Well, here we are. Another blog, another attempt to document the journey through various technical rabbit holes, side projects, and occasional pop culture musings.

### Why Hugo?

After evaluating several static site generators, I landed on Hugo for a few reasons:

- **Speed**: Build times measured in milliseconds, not seconds
- **Go-based**: Clean template syntax that doesn't make me want to flip tables
- **Mature ecosystem**: Been around since 2013, plenty of themes and documentation
- **Hugo Modules**: Modern dependency management for themes

### The Stack

This blog is built with:

```toml
[tools]
hugo-extended = "latest"
go = "latest"
```

Using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) for tool management makes it easy to keep Hugo and Go versions consistent across environments.

### What's Next?

Expect to see:

- Dev diaries from personal projects
- Technical deep-dives on interesting problems
- Infrastructure and tooling thoughts
- The occasional tangent about movies, games, or whatever else catches my attention

Let's see how long this lasts before it becomes yet another abandoned blog. Place your bets now.
